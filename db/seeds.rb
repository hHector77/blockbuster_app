# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

require 'faker'

# Crear clientes
10.times do
  Customer.create(name: Faker::Name.name, email: Faker::Internet.email)
end

# Crear pel√≠culas
10.times do
  Movie.create(
    title: Faker::Movie.title,
    genre: Faker::Book.genre,
    year: rand(1980..2023),
    customer: Customer.order("RANDOM()").first
